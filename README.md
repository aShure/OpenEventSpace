Modular system consisting of easy to build structural panels for room dividers, stages, exhibition furniture

Matching desks and tables of various heights are offloaded to this repo: https://github.com/etemu/OpenDeskAriane

Panels are optimized for 
1. minimum stock waste and best scale for circular economy
2. weight
3. modularity
4. ease of assembly and dissassembly

In addition to the standard versions there are models for triangular shaped ones and light emitting panels incorporating efficient LED lamps.

Panels can be connected in every direction, ie. to long rows or T-shaped room dividers. All different panel shapes can be connected and carried by two people.
Based on the supplied load simulations the structural integrity is sufficient for a temporary use as a horizontal platform. Panels can be stacked and laid flat to form an elevated stage.
